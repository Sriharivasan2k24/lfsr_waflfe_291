## How it works

8-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) built in Wokwi using D flip-flops, XOR gates, clock, and reset. It generates pseudo-random binary sequences by shifting register contents with XOR feedback. Using polynomial x⁸+x⁶+x⁵+x⁴+1, it cycles through 255 unique states before repeating.

## How to test

8-bit LFSR implemented in Wokwi using D flip-flops, XOR gates, clock, and reset. Generates pseudo-random sequences of 255 unique states before repeating.

## External hardware

Push button, LED, DIP switch
